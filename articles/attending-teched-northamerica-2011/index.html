<p>This year, I had the chance to visit US for the first time, and go to the TechEd NorthAmerica 2011 thanks to <a href="http://www.tellago.com/" target="_blank">Tellago</a>, the company I work for. I can’t be more thankful for working in such a cool company that will go through all the trouble of taking me from Buenos Aires to Atlanta for the TechEd. Apart from having a great time at the TechEd I also knew 4 of my co-workers: <a href="http://tellago.com/content/leadership" target="_blank">Elizabeth Redding</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx/default.aspx" target="_blank">Jesus Rodriguez</a>, <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/sureshg/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Suresh Girirajan</a> and <a href="http://professionalaspnet.com/" target="_blank">Chris Love</a>; which was totally awesome. I’ve also met some very cool guys from Microsoft that even said they loved the stuff we were doing with the <a href="http://www.tellagostudios.com/products/so-aware-test-workbench%E2%84%A2" target="_blank">SO-Aware Test Workbench</a>!</p>  <p>In the sessions I have attended, I have learnt so many cool stuff, here’s just a few I can think of:</p>  <ol>   <li>Windows Azure: Web, Worker and VM roles.</li>    <li>SQL Azure</li>    <li>Azure tables</li>    <li>Azure blobs</li>    <li>Azure Windows Connect</li>    <li>Azure AppFabric: Service Bus. Development Tools. Application Manager</li>    <li>Private Cloud (I’ve actually seen one in action right there running all the hands on labs)</li>    <li>Entity Framework 4.1: Database initializer. Entity framework migrations (for updating existing database). Enums support!!! (for those who were there :P)</li>    <li>SQL Server (code name ‘Denali’): text search and spatial improvements.</li>    <li>WCF 4.0: routing, discovery, dependency ping, web service governance.</li>    <li>WF: real world scenarios (Jesus Rodriguez), and State Machine (Ron Jacobs).</li>    <li>WIF: extensibility points.</li>    <li>Windows Phone 7: Microsoft Push Notification Service(<a href="http://watoolkitwp7.codeplex.com">http://watoolkitwp7.codeplex.com</a>)</li> </ol>  <p>And all this fun stuff in one week! It was certainly a remarkable experience, and I hope to be able to do it again soon.</p>

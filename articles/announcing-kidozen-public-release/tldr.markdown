On the 2nd of May we announced the public release of our new product [KidoZen](http://kidozen.com), an Enterprise Ready Mobile Backend as a Service. We have built this product base on the premise that bringing mobility into your Enterprise, is not a matter of adapting your existing apps to a mobile interface, but rather to provide real mobile experiences that make sense to your employees.

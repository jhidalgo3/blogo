From now on this blog is running with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)!

What is jekyll?
===============

Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. 

In short; I write my blogposts in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files and when I publish jekyll generate all the blog, which means not only the blogpost page but also the archives and by-tags indexes.

The result is an incredible performance because instead of doing database calls to some backend and rendering the pages server side, the web server already has the static content to serve.

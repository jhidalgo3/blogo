<p>We are very excited to announce that <a href="http://www.tellago.com/" target="_blank">Tellago</a> DevLabs just released a new open source project, <a href="https://github.com/TellagoDevLabs/Hermes" target="_blank">Hermes</a>. Hermes is a publish/subscribe messaging engine based on HTTP and MongoDB. The project is open source, and it’s hosted in GitHub. The code can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/TellagoDevLabs/Hermes" target="_blank">here</a>, and Hermes documentation can be reached <a href="https://github.com/TellagoDevLabs/Hermes/wiki" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>  <p>There are several things that makes Hermes a very attractive alternative for doing pub/sub:</p>  <ol>   <li>it provides a fully documented RESTful API making the engine as interoperable as it gets.</li>    <li>it is a very light weight .NET alternative.</li>    <li>it is open source.</li>    <li>it will run either on premise or in the cloud.</li> </ol>  <p>So don’t hesitate to give it a try, we are looking forward to your feedback :)</p>

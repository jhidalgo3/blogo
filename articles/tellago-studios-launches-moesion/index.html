<h2>So what is Moesion?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://cdn.machadogj.com/uploads/2011/09/image1.png"><img style="; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="moesion mobile apps" src="http://cdn.machadogj.com/uploads/2011/09/image_thumb1.png" alt="moesion mobile apps" width="135" height="232" align="right" border="0" /></a> Moesion is a cloud based platform that brings mobility to the IT world. With <a href="http://www.moesion.com" target="_blank">Moesion</a> you can do all kinds of stuff to manage your servers from your phone, tablet or desktop. Instead of a “remote desktop” solution that never fits well in mobile devices, we managed to create a touch-first interface with a great user experience as the main goal.</p>

<h2>How did we do it?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It merges cool new technologies like HTML 5, PubNub and of course Azure, this project has “cool” written all over it! With HTML 5 we were able to provide excellent user experience in the mobile ecosystems like smart phones and tablets, matching the native apps capabilities like touch, rotate and even swipe!</p>

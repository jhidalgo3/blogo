Back in my post about <a title="Structuring your source code" href="../2009/09/05/structuring-your-source-code/" target="_blank">structuring your source code</a>, I recommended to have a “DB” folder where you can keep your database. This is actually one of my favorite topics of configuration management, and the reason for this is that I realized how many companies and projects don’t keep their database under version control.
<h2>DB folder content</h2>
The folders that will rest inside the “DB” depend on each of the different database versioning schemes. Nevertheless, I would recommend having a “common scripts” folder where you can store common tasks you usually perform in your database. Examples of the scripts I usually store there are: clean up scripts, testing users, and testing data/configuration.
<h2>Database versioning schemes</h2>
I have come across with three different ways of versioning a database:
<ol> <li><a title="Database Version Control using backups" href="/2009/09/23/database-version-control-using-backups/" target="_blank">Store a backup of the database each time you modify something.</a></li> <li>Store “incremental changes” scripts.</li> <li>Use the Database project type shipped with Visual Studio Team Edition.</li>
</ol>
There is probably a forth option which would be to keep the database in xml files. This is more common when using certain ORM frameworks. Unfortunately I have never worked with such a scheme :s. Regardless of the scheme that suites you better, I strongly recommend to keep the database under version control. This is just the first of a series of posts I will be doing about Database Version Control, and the next posts will describe each of the schemes I have worked with.

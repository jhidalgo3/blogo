There are a lot of wrong things about CSS, but in the there’s been other languages created to empower CSS, and once you get used to any of these there’s no going back. The most common are SASS and LESS which have been around for a while. While these languages are very good (in particular SASS) and they do most of the things that Stylus does, there’s one aspect of CSS that they don’t address by design: the syntax.

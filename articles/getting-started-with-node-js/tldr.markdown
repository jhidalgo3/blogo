node.js is a development platform based on Javascript created by Ryan Dahl and currently maintained by the cloud provider [Joyent](http://www.joyent.com/). The interesting thing about node.js is that it runs in a single thread, and attacks concurrency by trying to block the CPU as little as possible (if at all).

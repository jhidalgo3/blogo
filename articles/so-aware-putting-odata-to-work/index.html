In my previous posts I have explained about REST and the different options we have in .NET for building RESTful services. One of these options is to use WCF DataServices, a WCF programming model with which you can expose a data model in a RESTful way using the new OData protocol. OData is a protocol that extends AtomPub to provide complex querying capabilities.

Here is a real case: SO-Aware, a service repository tool by Tellago Studios that provides an OData-based RESTful API. With SO-Aware you can keep your WCF services information and configuration in one place, and have your services and clients consume this through a RESTful API.

Here are some useful links:

So go ahead and check it out, you'll learn two cool things: how OData can be used in real products, and an excellent tool for service governance.

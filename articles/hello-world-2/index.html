As the name implies this is my first post, my name is Gustavo Machado and I am a .NET developer from Argentina. I figured I'd create a blog to share some of my experiences in the field, and why not keep them in one place. Hopefully you will find some of this stuff useful. I have been working for a few years with .NET technologies, and different SW development methodologies. I've worked with the well known cascade development model, with prototyped, and now I am working with Scrum, all them with their advantages and disadvantages. My next chanllenge will be to start working in a more Test Driven fashion (TDD), so I will keep posting my findings regarding this. Cheers! Gus
